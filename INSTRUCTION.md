I have been working as microservices using node on aws.

Can you categorise aws services required for building up micro-services, which can be aws s3, lambda, kinesis, sqs, sns, etc.

Refer to /Users/stevengong/study/aws-common-questions/README.md, and /Users/stevengong/study/aws-common-questions/API_Management/API_Management.md, can you come out a API_Management related common interview question?
